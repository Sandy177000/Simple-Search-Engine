# Simple-Search-Engine
A search engine is a tool that allows users to search for information, images, videos, and more on the internet.
Google.com is a well-known example of a search engine.
The project is about implementing a simple search engine and understanding how it works behind the scenes.
There is a demo of the project, which shows a web application with a search bar and a search button.
The project allows users to search for top 30 results according to their query and displays their search history.
The two main functions of the project are to perform a search and to get user search history.
The project only includes two functions for simplicity.
The function to perform a search is complex and involves algorithms like Depth first search.
